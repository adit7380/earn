7. AD INTEGRATION
   - We've created a dedicated file called `ads_integration.php` that contains all the required ad integration functions
   - Include this file in your header.php or any page where you want to display ads:
     ```php
     require_once 'ads_integration.php';
     ```
   
   - To add the ad SDK to your header:
     ```php
     <?php insert_ad_header(); ?>
     ```
   
   - To display different types of ads, use these functions:
     * For rewarded ads in the spin section:
       ```php
       <?php insert_reward_ad_spin(); ?>
       ```
       Then in your JavaScript code, call:
       ```javascript
       showRewardAd(function() {
           // Code to execute after user watches ad and gets reward
       });
       ```

     * For rewarded ads in the watch section:
       ```php
       <?php insert_reward_ad_watch(); ?>
       ```
       Then in your JavaScript code, call:
       ```javascript
       showWatchAd(adId, function(adId) {
           // Code to execute after user watches ad and gets reward
       });
       ```

     * For automatic interstitial ads:
       ```php
       <?php insert_interstitial_ad(); ?>
       ```

     * For banner ads (sizes: '300x250', '468x60', '160x300', '320x50', '160x600', '728x90'):
       ```php
       <?php insert_banner_ad('300x250'); ?>
       ```

     * For popunder ads:
       ```php
       <?php insert_popunder_ad(); ?>
       ```
